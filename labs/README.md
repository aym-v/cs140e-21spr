## The labs

Below describes where we're going and why.   The labs themselves have a
lot more prose on each topic.  There is a pointer to where we currently
are: the labs after this point can still see significant revisions.

I would strongly recommend reading the labs carefully before starting.
And then, once you finish, going back and reading them for things you
missed the first time, and also looking closely at your code --- for 
every line, you should understand why we needed it or what it does.
And on second reading, you'll likely find some lines that we could have
cut out!

---------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 1: Going down.

The first chunk of the class will be writing all the low-level code needed
to run the r/pi and using modern techniques to validate it.  Doing so will
remove all magic from what is going on since all of the interesting code
on both the pi and Unix side will be written by you:

  - [0-blink](0-blink/): get everyone up to speed and all
    necessary software installed.  This should be a fast lab.

  - [1-gpio](1-gpio/): start getting used to understanding hardware
    datasheets by writing your own code to control the r/pi `GPIO` pins
    using the Broadcom document GPIO description.  You will use this to
    implement your own blink and a simple network between your r/pi's.

  - [2-cross-check](2-cross-check/): you will use read-write logging
    of all loads and stores to device memory to verify that your GPIO
    code is equivalent to everyone else's.  If one person got the code
    right, everyone will have it right.

    A key part of this class is having you write all the low-level,
    fundamental code your OS will need.  The good thing about this
    approach is that there is no magic.  A bad thing is that a single
    mistake can make a miserable quarter.  Thus, we show you modern
    (or new) tricks for checking code correctness.

  - [3-bootloader](3-bootloader/): two of the biggest pieces of code
    we've given you have been the Unix-side and pi-side bootloader code
    (`pi-install` and `bootloader.bin` respectively).  So this lab has
    you implement your own and get rid of ours.

    The most common r/pi bootloader out there uses the `xmodem` protocol.
    This approach is overly complicated.  You will do a much simpler,
    more-likely-to-be-correct protocol.  It has the advantage that it
    will later make it easier to boot over the network.

  - [4-uart](4-uart/): the last key bit of code we've given you is for
    controlling the UART (`uart.o`); so this lab has you write your own
    and remove ours.

    To do so you'll write your first real device driver --- for the UART
    --- using only the Broadcom document.  At this point, all key code
    on the pi is written by you.  You will use the cross checking code
    from lab 2 to verify your implementation matches everyone else's.


If you are interested in taking this further, there is a lab from last
year we skipped (zoom makes some things hard), that you might find
worth doing:

  - [optional lab: replay](https://github.com/dddrrreee/cs140e-20win/tree/master/labs/5-replay).   This is a lab from the previous class: in a twist on lab-3, 
    you will use Unix system calls to interpose between your Unix and
    pi bootloader code, record all reads and writes, and test your
    bootloader implementation by replaying these back, both as seen and
    with systematic corruption.

    This approach comes from the model-checking community, and I believe
    after you implement this lab and test (and fix) your bootloader you
    will be surprised if it breaks later.  (In general, the approach
    we follow here applies well to other network protocols which have
    multi-step protocols and many potential failure modes, difficult to
    test in practice.)

    Using read-write equivalence and simple systematic exploration will
    let you check the code thoroughly enough that you will be surprised
    if the code ever breaks.

At this point you have written low-level device driver code, a bootloader,
and pretty much replaced all of our code.  You've learned how to crush it
under a barrage of automatic checks (especially if you do the optional
lab) and done a simple implementation of a fake pi environment that
allows you to check correctness of pi code using your laptop.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 2: Understanding the machine

This set of labs intends to get you more comfortable writing low-level
code, understanding the machine code it gets translated to, and also
how the machine works (including its hardware devices).

  - [5-digital-analyzer](5-digital-analyzer/): the goal of this lab
    is getting you comfortable with machine code and starting to build
    an intuition for how the hardware actually works.
    As a driving application you'll build a fast, accurate digital
    analyzer and test signal generator that have timing error in the
    tens of nanoseconds.  At the end you'll have software that appears
    more accurate than a $400 Saleae (at least the ones made in 2020).

    The lab is a great example of how writing all the code yourself, and
    having a simple system makes it very easy to do things in-practice
    impossible on a traditional OS such as Linux or MacOS.

  - [6-sw-uart](6-sw-uart/):  so far we've treated the internals
    of hardware as a black box that you configure by writing odd values
    to strange addresses.  In this lab, you'll start to see what device
    hardware actually does by writing a software "bit-banging" version
    of the UART protocol used in lab 4.

    Writing your own software UART is a great way to see what the hardware
    UART is doing --- and, as you will, see, it's actually not much!
    For the most part, all hardware bus/communication protocols (such as
    SPI, I2C, UART, etc) are simply one or two signals that flip between
    1 and 0, possibly with some timing constraints.  The mechanical
    simplicity of device communication protocols stands in sharp contrast
    to the complexity of the datasheets that describe the hardware that
    implements them.

    After this lab, you'll start to understand that if a data sheet sucks,
    you can frequently build your own software version.  This can be
    helpful when starting a new machine, or doing thing the hardware
    cannot (e.g., supporting many devices concurrently).

    At a practical level, a software UART gives you a second source of
    output for communicating with your laptop, which will turn out to
    be very useful later when we do networking.

    Finally, you'll have the startling surprise of seeing first-hand that
    --- despite the wildly different domains --- your code from last lab
    (digital analyzer) and this lab is almost identical.  In particular,
    your test generating code from last lab is essentially the same as
    how your UART code transmits bytes and your scope code is basically
    how your UART code receives bytes.  It's *interesting* when methods
    used to solve apparently different problems in very different domains
    turn out to be almost equivalant.  As one actionable, semi-meta twist:
    you'll be using your scope code to verify your software UART.

At this point you should be much more comfortable understanding how the
hardware works, what the machine code means, and how to reason about low
level code.  And, perhaps even better, know how to figure such things
out when you do not know them by, for example, writing some C code,
compiling it, and examining the machine code or by measuring how long
it takes to run.

We are now going to switch gears to intensively implementing core OS
functionality: interrupts, threads, virtual memory and file systems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 2: Execution: interrupts, threads, user-level processes.

  - [7-interrupts](7-interrupts/): you will walk through a simple,
    self-contained implementation of pi interrupts (for timer-interrupts),
    kicking each line until you understand what, how, why.  You will
    use these to then implement a version of `gprof` (Unix statistical
    profiler) in about 30 lines.

    Perhaps the thing I love most about this course is that because we
    write all the code ourselves, we aren't constantly fighting some
    large, lumbering OS that can't get out of its own way.  As a result,
    simple ideas only require simple code.  This lab is a great example:
    a simple idea, about twenty minutes of code, an interesting result.
    If we did on Unix could spend weeks or more fighting various corner
    cases and have a result that is much much much slower and, worse,
    in terms of insight.


  - [8-device-interrupts](8-device-interrupts): if you keep doing this 
    kind of work the single most common
    fancy "OS" type thing you'll likely do in the future is to setup
    GPIO pin interrupts so that you can get notified when a hardware
    device has data.  So, in this lab we'll setup GPIO interrupts
    and tune how we do general interrupts.

    Without interrupts, it's difficult to get networking working, since
    our GPIO pins (and our UART options) have limited space and, thus,
    unless our code checks them at exactly the right time, incoming
    messages will vaporize.

    We've spent two labs on interrupts, but this can be a tricky topic --
    both because of correctness issues and because you have to get used
    to understanding architecture manuals.   This understanding will
    help you in the next two labs.  The fact that you have become much
    more comfortable saving and restoring registers will save you many
    debugging headaches in the next week.

***We are currently here.***

  - [9-threads](9-threads/): we build a simple, but functional
    threads package.  You will write the code for non-preemptive context
    switching:  Most people don't understand such things so, once again,
    you'll leave lab knowing something many do not.

Tentative:
   - For lab 10: Akshay and I are debating, but it seems likely we'll
     do user-level processes and/or dynamically linked tasks so that
     it's easy to add different types of features (such as interrupts
     or memory protection) without modifying the application.

   - The following labs are going to see some major surgery.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Part 3: file systems.

  - [11-fuse.A](11-fuse/): In this lab you will use the FUSE file
    system to wrap up your pi as a special file system and mount it on your
    laptop, where you can use standard utilities (and your normal shell)
    to interact with it.  You can then control the pi by reading / writing
    to special files: e.g., echoing a `1` to `pi/reboot` to cause a reboot,
    echoing a program to `/pi/run` to run it.

    This lab is a great example of the power of Unix's simple, powerful
    OO-interface that lets you package a variety of disparate things as
    files, directories, links and interact with them using a uniform set
    of verbs (e.g., `open()-read()-write()-close()`).

  - [12-fuse.B](12-fuse/): We continue fuse since it was a big lab :). 

  - [13-fat32](13-fat32/): The SD and virtual memory are the biggest
    unknowns in our universe, so we'll bang out quick versions of each,
    and then circle back around and make your system more real.

    You will write a simple read-only FAT32 file system that can read from
    your SD card. You will use this to do a very OS-style "hello world":
    use your FAT32 to read `hello-fixed.bin` from last lab from your SD
    card, jump to it and run it.

### Part 4: Virtual Memory

  - [14-vm](14-vm/): You take a working VM system and, using the
    ARM documents, replace its page table manipulation with your own.
    You also add exception handling to catch protection and missing
    translation faults.   The former gives you the tools to start doing
    user-level protection, the latter for demand paging and extending
    a stack as code accesses it.

  - [15-vm-ops](15-vm-ops/): The previous lab defined the main noun in the
    virtual memory universe (the page table); this lab does the main verbs
    used to set up the VM hardware, including how to synchronize hardware,
    translation, and page table state (more subtle than it sounds).
    At the end you should be able to delete all our starter code.

***[HAVE NOT UPDATED THE LABS BELOW]***

#### Part 5: processes

  - [16-processes](16-user-level): today you will make user level
    processes.  This will combine the virtual memory, system calls, and
    threads into a capstone implementation.  You will use this ability to
    your fuse-FS support multiprocessing, so that you can have multiple
    programs running at the same time.

  - Additional labs that we can fit in to make the above more real and more
    integrated.

### Optional labs:


  - virtualization: this lab will show how
    to virtualize hardware.  We will use simple tricks to transparently flip
    how your pi code is compiled so you can run it on Unix, only shipping
    the GPIO reads and writes to a small stub on the pi.  As a result,
    you have full Unix debugging for pi code (address space protection,
    valgrind, etc) while getting complete fidelity in how the pi will behave
    (since we ship the reads and writes to it directly).

  - sonar-int: we take a bit of a fun break,
    and bang out a quick device driver for a simple sonar device. You
    will then get a feel for how interrupts can be used to simplify code
    structure (counter-intuitive!)  by adapting the interrupt code from
    the previous lab to make this code better.
