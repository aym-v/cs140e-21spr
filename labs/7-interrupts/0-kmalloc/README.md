What to do:
  1. Implement the routines in `kmalloc.c`
  2. Make sure all the tests pass by running `make check`.
  3. Copy `kmalloc.c` to libpi/src and update your `put-your-src-here.mk`, comment out

            # USE_LOCAL_KMALLOC = ./kmalloc.c

    in the `Makefile` and make sure `make check` still passes.
